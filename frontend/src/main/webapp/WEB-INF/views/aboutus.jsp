<h4>ABOUT US</h4>
<p>A laptop, often called a notebook or "notebook computer", is a small, portable personal computer with a "clamshell" form factor, an alphanumeric keyboard on the lower part of the "clamshell" and a thin LCD or LED computer screen on the upper part, which is opened up to use the computer. Laptops are folded shut for transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.</p>
<h3>Business laptop</h3>
<p>A business laptop is a laptop designed for those in a workplace. Typically, it is ruggedised, with consumer facing features, like high resolution sound removed to allow the device to be used for pure productivity.</p>
<h3>Dell Inspiron</h3>
<p>The screen is a high-glossy display and measures 17.3 inches diagonally, and has a resolution of 1600x900 pixels. HDMI and VGA video outputs also are available.</p>
<h3>IBM ThinkPad ThinkLight</h3>
<p>A white or yellow LED (depending on model) is located on the top edge of the display, illuminating the keyboard to allow use in low-light conditions. It is activated with the key combination Fn-PgUp (the bottom left and top right keys of the keyboard). Newer ThinkPads use the combination Fn-Space instead. The on-screen display of ThinkPad computers will display a light on and a light off indicator. The ThinkLight can be activated when the monitor is on or off but not while the PC is off.</p>
